# Overview

I recently developed a console-based to-do list application in C++ to further my learning as a software engineer. This project allowed me to apply and deepen my understanding of C++ language syntax while creating a practical and useful tool. The to-do list manager enables users to add, remove, and view tasks seamlessly within the console environment.

# Software Demonstration

In the demonstration video, I walk through the functionality of the to-do list manager, showcasing how users can interact with the application to add, remove, and view tasks. The emphasis is on the code walkthrough, highlighting key aspects of the C++ syntax that I learned and implemented during the development process.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used Visual Studio Code as my primary integrated development environment (IDE). Visual Studio Code provides a lightweight yet powerful platform for C++ development, offering features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and easy integration with version control systems.

The programming language used for this project is C++. I opted for C++ due to its efficiency, flexibility, and widespread use in systems programming. The standard template library (STL) was particularly beneficial for managing data structures like vectors to store and manipulate the tasks.

# Useful Websites

During the development of the to-do list manager, I found the following websites particularly helpful:

- [cplusplus.com](http://www.cplusplus.com/): A comprehensive resource for C++ documentation, tutorials, and references.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): An invaluable community-driven platform where I could find solutions to specific coding challenges and seek advice from experienced developers.

# Future Work

As with any software project, there are areas for improvement and additional features that could enhance the to-do list manager:

- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to support multiple users with personalized to-do lists.
- **Persistent Storage:** Integrate a file system or database for persistent storage of tasks between application sessions.
- **Task Prioritization:** Allow users to prioritize tasks or assign due dates for better organization.
- **User Interface (UI) Improvements:** Consider implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
